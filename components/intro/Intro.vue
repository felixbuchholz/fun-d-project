      <h3>A concentration of shareholder power</h3>
      <p>
        As indirect shareholders of the companies in funds, index fund investors
        rely on the funds’ asset managers to cast their vote (“proxy”). The
        largest three managers – Blackrock, Vanguard, and State Street – vote
        about 20% of the shares in most large companies, most of these shares
        are in passive index funds. And in reality, their voting power is even
        higher as participation from retail investors
        <i
          class="qtip tip-top"
          data-tip="Individuals, non-professional investors who generally invest way smaller amounts than larger, institutional investors. Retail investors represent about 30% in public stock ownership."

        in shareholder voting is only 28%

      <p>
        That concentration of shareholder power sparked a debate over the
        influence of the world’s largest asset managers. The involvement of
        asset managers with the companies in their funds affects thousands of
        companies, the economy and society more broadly.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Yet, the point of index investing is a passive approach to investments.
        Less work means less costs. Once an index fund is launched, asset
        managers pay license fees to index providers.
        <i
          class="qtip tip-top"
          data-tip="Index providers create lists ('indices') in stocks and other asset class indices. They classify and define “markets” and sub-markets: an index provides a benchmark of performance for that market or sector. A well-known example is S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, that has the S&amp;P 500 index."
          ><fa icon="question-circle"
        /></i>
        But fund managers incur minimal costs on optimizing the fund portfolio
        or the specifics of respective securities.
        <i
          class="qtip tip-bottom"
          data-tip="Securities is the broader term that is used to refer to equity and debt (also called fixed income). Stocks (or shares) refers to equity, which represents ownership in a company."
          ><fa icon="question-circle"
        /></i>
        The portfolio of an index fund consists of the securities in an index.
        This passive investment approach contrasts with the requirement for
        funds to vote their proxies on shareholder meetings. The largest asset
        managers are voting on hundreds of thousands of resolutions put to vote
        at shareholder meetings for companies all over the world.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Engaged shareholders</h3>
      <p>
        Over the past years, index fund managers have been scrutinized for
        underinvest ing in governance and voting policies: they would too often
        vote with management.
        <i
          class="qtip tip-top"
          data-tip="In our data, funds disclose how they voted: which is mostly “for” or “against” a proposal. Proposals brought by management are - not surprisingly - always supported by management: they recommend shareholders to vote “for”. Almost always, management recommends to vote  against  shareholder proposals."

        or fully outsource their decision-forming to a small selection of proxy
        advisors.

              Proxy advisors consult to investors about how to vote on the range
              of matters that require shareholder approval at the public
              corporations in an investor portfolio. ISS and Glass Lewis are the
              two dominant proxy advisory firms. A concern about proxy advisors
              is that many institutional investors (like asset managers)
              essentially delegate their voting decisions to these two advisors.
              <a

              >
              <br />This is less of a concern for the largest asset managers,
              which have a special “stewardship” department to engage with
              portfolio companies and direct funds’ votes.

        This raised concerns that the rise of passive investing translated into
        growing passivity of shareholders towards management. In voting on
        proposals, often the most telling cases are when asset managers get to
        choose between supporting management or activist shareholders. Indeed,
        even though most shareholder proposals don’t pass, the issue being on
        the agenda can already ignite a debate.

              A company’s management team acts as agents for the owners
              (shareholders) of a company. Conflicts of interests arise when a
              managers’ own interests contrast with those of shareholders. And
              different shareholders might have conflicting ideas on what is
              best for a company. Annual shareholder meetings are an opportunity
              for a company’s shareholders to raise issues that they could not
              reach consensus on with that company’s management. Activists seek
              to confront management by submitting proposals for reform on a
              variety issues, such as removal of certain directors, executive
              compensation or disclosure of climate change risks. Sometimes for
              reasons selfish to those shareholders, sometimes to benefit a
              larger set of stakeholders. Index funds are not activists, in that
              they don’t bring their own resolutions to the table, nor publicly
              attack management to provoke a specific change.

        However, an excessive passivity of the largest asset managers in
        scrutinizing management would defeat the option for shareholders to hold
        management accountable. Indirectly this would forfeit the opportunity to
        vote for all people that have (a tiny) share in a fund. The passive
        giants - Vanguard, State Street and Blackrock - are all attentive to
        this concern. Each of them explicitly emphasize and explicate their
        proactive approach in engaging with the companies in their funds.
        However, it remains difficult for investors in index funds to assess how
        their approach plays out in practice.

        Financial markets are showing more interest in issues such as

        and
        <a href="https://www.unpri.org/download?ac=5599" target="_blank"
          >income inequality</a
        >. Rather than focusing on shareholder returns only, there is a growing
        public demand for companies to increase corporate accountability. The
        substantial voting power of the three largest asset managers puts them
        in a spotlight. They can often tip the needle on these more “societal”
        proposals brought by shareholders. As law professor John Morley writes:
        “The future of American capitalism belongs to a handful of giant
        investment managers”.
        <a
          href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID3384274_code669617.pdf?abstractid=3225555&amp;mirid=1"

        So, the voting behavior of the three largest asset managers matters.
        Every mutual fund is required to publish annually how it casted each
        vote on all proposals for all the portfolio companies. Even though the
        data is public, its published in a format that even investment fund
        enthusiasts will find obscure. For the millions of mainstream fund
        investors (such as everyone who has some form of retirement plan), the
        public data barely give a clear picture of how the funds they invested
        in voted. Also SEC

        Commissioner Robert Jackson previously called out the lack of
        transparency of how index funds votes.

      <h3>Engaged shareholders</h3>
      <p>
        This visualization addresses this concern by providing a peek into
        voting patterns of the world’s largest financial shareholders: asset
        management firms Blackrock, Vanguard and State Street.Most proposals at
        shareholder meetings come from management and cover organizational
        issues such as the appointment of an accountant or board directors.
        Shareholders (“activists”) can submit proposals as well as a means to
        provoke a certain course of action by the company

              Eligibility rules of the US Securities and Exchange Commission
              (SEC) state that shareholders who own more than $2,000 in stock or
              1% of the company are permitted to initiate a shareholder
              proposal, whichever is lower. In November 2019, the SEC proposed
              to increase that threshold to prevent the inappropriate or
              excessive use of company resources and waste of shareholders’ time
              and attention. Not everyone agrees with that.

        Unless the SEC allows a company to exempt a shareholder resolution from
        the agenda, it has to be placed on the agenda for the next available
        shareholder meeting. Shareholders may try to reach consensus with
        management through informal dialogue and (sometimes aggressive) public
        campaigns to move management’s position. The largest asset managers will
        oftentimes be involved in these cases, as a form of “shareholder
        engagement”. Since this happens behind closed doors, assessing this
        “soft” influence is impossible. Our analysis therefore looks at the
        cases where activist shareholders come to open confrontation with
        management and arrive at a proxy vote at the shareholder meeting. As
        follows, we explore how the world’s largest asset managers voted on
        shareholder proposals as an explicit expression of their influence.
