            <p>Markets have not been the same after the global financial crisis in 2008. If anything, it showed that financial markets can be unpredictable – also for experts. Investment funds that seek to “beat the market” may succeed for a while, but consistent market outperformance is extremely rare. In contrast, the premise of an index fund is simplicity: by buying the companies of an existing index, it rides with the market rather than trying to outsmart it. 
            In the last decade, people started moving away from more expensive investment funds and massively opted in for the low-cost alternative of index funds. </p> <p> The rise of this passive approach to investing is one of the most remarkable developments in financial markets since the crisis. Passive investing democratizes financial markets in that it offers the general public an affordable option to gain from investing in capital markets, without taking much risk. 
            However, it also changed the very fabric of financial markets – raising new issues.
            This visual analysis takes on the influence of asset management companies that emerged from the passive investing trend.</p>
